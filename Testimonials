                      I worked with Helen during the transformation of a programme from Waterfall, to Agile working practices, within a distributed team. Helen’s ability to see the bigger picture working at Programme level one minute, and be down in the detail, guiding specific behaviours one-to-one the next, proved her resilient and flexible (Agile) mindset to be an asset to this team, as it would be to any team. It was a pleasure working with Helen, and I’d actively welcome the opportunity to work alongside her again in the future.

                      Paul is great at bringing a positive attitude and a wealth of experience which he is keen to share and help us along our Agile journey.  He can relate to team members at all levels and coach us in Agile methods while relating back to previous experience, rather than everything being theoretical.  He is also very forthcoming with praise, which really helps and encourages team learning.

                    Paul is very much hands on coach who gets involved in the team from the off. This really helps with building trusting relationships across teams and leaders. With his natural ability to coach, teach and mentor he has been able to pass on great skills that have allowed me to progress my career based on his guidance. Paul’s approach is open, honest and based on fact.  Having Paul available for assistance in the creation and delivery of learning materials has also been of massive value, not just personally for me but for many teams he has worked alongside. Paul is a genuine person who is easy to speak to and made me feel comfortable sharing challenges and problems. I genuinely appreciate all his efforts and feel he helped me to get where I am now.                    </div>

                      Paul has tailored my own learning by educating me to practically apply theory, and to reflect on the “as is” in order to continuously improve – for customers and myself.  He has supported the teams learning and their Agile journey via group sessions and 1-2-1 coaching, bringing theory to life with live examples – this has had tremendous effects and has ensured that as a team we progress on a journey together.
                      Paul is adaptable and approachable and responds to requests and feedback positively, allowing the teams to adapt to an agile approach that suits us all, and does not preach a one size fits all position. In addition, Paul challenged me personally, particularly my ways of thinking, allowing me to progress to a Product Owner role, and has helped me to realise that customer journey management is where I feel I want to be – I thank you for that.  Overall, working with Paul has been a pleasure – he has had a profound impact on me and the team, and I hope to work with him again in the future.

                      Belinda worked for us as a Business Analyst for 6 months on an internal software development programme. Belinda is very personable and engaged well with a fairly large and dispersed group of stakeholders. She often went beyond her role and acted as a coach for those in the business that where new to the process. Very diligent and adaptable, she was a huge asset to the team.

                      Paul is a very knowledgeable Agile Coach and comes with a great deal of experience in the various ways of Agile working. He is particularly insightful when coaching around areas of difference between the frameworks available (e.g. Scrum vs Kanban etc) and their potential suitability for individual teams and organisations.
                      Paul is very approachable and has a great sense of humour so is able to bring the Agile concepts to life for clients in an engaging and entertaining manner which can help to quickly build a sense of trust and psychological safety with a team. This also ensures team training sessions are fun as well as informative. His practical business skills and attention to detail mean Paul is also very helpful where coaching is needed to create informative and impactful impediment data visuals to senior stakeholders – for example to convey the impact or potential costs of delay to a wider audience to enable a decision to be reached on a way forward.
                      Overall Paul is a great team player to have on board and a key asset in helping a business to implement an Agile style of working or further embed the principles and techniques with more mature teams.
